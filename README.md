# Counter Blox - Kill Entire Enemy Team

### About

When you execute this script by pressing E (default key, you can change it inside the script) the script would fire a RemoteEvent 5 times with all headshots and coming from the AWP weapon which seems to deal the most damage. This script kills everyone instantly and ensures you and your team an instant victory.
